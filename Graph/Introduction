 Graph - graph is a set of vertices and edges. Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. 
 Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. 
    Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network.

   --  Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node).

    --  Graphs are used in geographical applications to represent networks of communication, 
         highways, cities, etc. For example, we can represent the cities and their interconnections with edges.

    --  Graphs are used in image processing as well. For example, we can represent any digital
            image as a graph. Each pixel of the image will be represented with a vertex. Pixels having some relation will be connected through edges.

    --  Graphs are used in recommendation engines. For example, Netflix uses graphs to recommend movies to its users.
            Also, Google maps uses graphs to find the best route between various locations.

    --  Graphs are used in modeling dependencies in project management software like
            Microsoft Project. Each project is represented as a vertex(or node) and dependencies between projects are represented as edges(or arcs).
